## Networking Basics

## These are my personal notes while learning networking fundamentals

# Computer Network----
A computer network is a group of computers and devices connected to each other to share data and resources.

In simple words, when computers are connected with each other — for example, my computer connected to my friend’s computer, or my computer connected to my home Wi-Fi

## Examples:

Home Wi-Fi network

College computer lab network

Office LAN network

## INTERNET

The Internet is the connection of multiple computer networks across regions, countries, or worldwide.

In simple terms:

The Internet is a network of networks.

It is used to access information and communicate online.

## Uses of the Internet:----

Browsing websites,

Sending emails,

Online communication (chat, video calls),

Online learning, payments, and entertainment.

## important 
  you take a example of google what do you think how networks work here 

 ## Very Important line

 Google uses TCP for reliable services like Search, Gmail, and Drive, while UDP is used for real-time services like YouTube streaming and Google Meet.

 ### When you search on Google 

Protocols used:  HTTPS over TCP

What happens:---

You type google.com

Browser sends HTTPS request

HTTPS runs on TCP

TCP ensures:---

All data reaches safely

No packet missing

Google server replies back

## Gmail / Google Drive 

Protocols used:  HTTPS over TCP

Why?

Emails & files are critical

Data loss  unacceptable

Security  required

### HTTPS gives:

Encryption

Authentication

Integrity

# In short:

Emails & files = Secure TCP

## Why TCP here?

Search results must be accurate

Missing data is not allowed

## In short:

Google Search = HTTPS → TCP

# one concern that why HTTPS use over TCP(in example like google )----

    because https provide security - encryption,authentication,integrity 

    imagine you connect with public wifi , without https only tcp what happens your username or password will be visible and also may be possible data is stolen , man in the middle attcak will be happen , also cookies can be stolen 

    if i used https over tcp then our data is safe 

   # example--- 

    if i connected to public wifi then we use browser for something like searching google.com

    so here https works

    https starts and check TLS verification

    it checks server have certification valid or trusted

    if valid then it allow to use and it is safe to use

    https does not check wifi network but it secure the data between user and server (end to end)

    if any unwanted or any kind of situation will happen then browser show warning and say “your connection is not private”

    when we use https and i open any browser then MITM attack is not possible if the certificate is valid and no browser warning is ignored

    because it cant see our data like username, password

    they only see encrypted packets 



## TCP (RANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL)

    the idea is it will insure that data will reach its destination not be corrupted on the way 

    so if you want to share data completely to someone in an applocation that applicaation is used TCP 

   # Characteristics:

    Connection-oriented

    Data order maintain

    Packet loss hua → resend

   # Used for:

    HTTP / HTTPS   

    Website login

    File download

    Email sending (SMTP, IMAP)

    File transfer

    Database communication

    
    # “Jahan data important hai → TCP”

## UDP (USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL)
you will not care about data is reaching in its destination or not  whomever you want to send the data 

example like video conferencing not all data ,totally fine bythis 

# Use hota hai jab speed > accuracy

# Characteristics:

Connectionless

No resend

Faster than TCP

# Used for:

Video calls (Zoom, Meet)

Live streaming

DNS queries

Online gaming

# important (connection vs connectionless oriented)
 
  connection--
   
   first connection establish then sends the data 
      if data is not received  then resend the data ,because data order is maintened  
      example--email sending ,login any systems etc

   # How it works:

    Client says: Hello, can I connect?

    Server says: Yes

    Client says: Okay, let’s start

  connectionless--
   
   direct sends the data 
    it dont care about data is reached at its destination or not 
    example-- live streaming , video call or online communcation 

 

 ## HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol)

  # it uses a port number- 80( default port)
  # it is not encrypted
  # data send as plain text
  # attack is mostly possible (like MITM ATTACK)
  # it is rarely used in modern tachnology 

   http is a protocol using this data is transfer between client(browser) and web server 

   if i open a website eg- google.com , in which http/*https* send a request to web server and then server response back with the data 
   
   * Most modern websites use HTTPS rather than HTTP due to security reasons. 

## HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure)

 https is secure protocol for data transfer bw client and server 

 # it uses a port number- 443 (default port)
 # it is encypted 
 # data send as encypted form 
 # attack is rarely possible 
 # it is mostly used in modern technology
