# Networking Basics 

These are my personal notes while learning networking fundamentals
for cybersecurity and SOC basics.


## Computer Network

A computer network is a group of computers and devices connected to each other to share data and resources.

In simple words, when computers are connected with each other — for example,
my computer connected to my friend’s computer, or
my computer connected to my home Wi-Fi

it is called a computer network.

Examples:-------
-Home Wi-Fi network
-College computer lab network
-Office LAN network
